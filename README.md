## <br>**➲ Project description**
In response to the escalating challenge of unwanted commercial bulk emails, or spam, which severely impacts email servers and user productivity,  I have developed a Spam-Ham Classification model. This model leverages machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to effectively discern between legitimate and spam SMS messages. By accurately distinguishing between the two.

## <br>**➲ The Dataset**
The dataset consists of 5572 entries and two columns:

* Label: This column indicates whether the message is classified as "ham" (legitimate) or "spam" (unwanted commercial bulk email).

* Message: This column contains the actual text content of the messages.
